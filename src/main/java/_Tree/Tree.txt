Trees: Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.

One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer
Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

Main applications of trees include:
1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
5. Router algorithms
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).
